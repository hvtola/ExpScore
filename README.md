This repository contains data and scriptfiles for the study presented in Mannberg et al., "Decomposing risk - Using a continuous terrain exposure score to understand the impact of the avalanche forecast on ski tourers - replication data". The paper develops a continues instrument for exposure to avalanche terrain and analyses if backcountry skiers' terrain choices correlate with information in the avalanche forecast.

The main data was collected via API from Strava and the Norwegian Avalanche Warning Service (NAWS) during 2022 - 2024. Participants were recruited via the CARE panel, public avalanche seminars, and social media. The dataset contains information about avalanche forecasts in Norway for the time period 2017-2024, geographic tour information from tours made in the time period 2017 - 2024, and basic background information for participants in the CARE panel. The total sample size consists of 1086 individuals and 26,703 tours. The data has been anonymised.
